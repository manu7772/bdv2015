Welcome to the Symfony Standard Edition -\/ a fully-\/functional Symfony2 application that you can use as the skeleton for your new applications.

This document contains information on how to download, install, and start using Symfony. For a more detailed explanation, see the \href{http://symfony.com/doc/2.3/book/installation.html}{\tt Installation} chapter of the Symfony Documentation.

\subsection*{1) Installing the Standard Edition }

When it comes to installing the Symfony Standard Edition, you have the following options.

\subsubsection*{Use Composer ({\itshape recommended})}

As Symfony uses \href{http://getcomposer.org/}{\tt Composer} to manage its dependencies, the recommended way to create a new project is to use it.

If you don't have Composer yet, download it following the instructions on \href{http://getcomposer.org/}{\tt http\+://getcomposer.\+org/} or just run the following command\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
\end{DoxyVerb}


Then, use the {\ttfamily create-\/project} command to generate a new Symfony application\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}php composer.phar create-project symfony/framework-standard-edition path/to/install
\end{DoxyVerb}


Composer will install Symfony and all its dependencies under the {\ttfamily path/to/install} directory.

\subsubsection*{Download an Archive File}

To quickly test Symfony, you can also download an \href{http://symfony.com/download}{\tt archive} of the Standard Edition and unpack it somewhere under your web server root directory.

If you downloaded an archive \char`\"{}without vendors\char`\"{}, you also need to install all the necessary dependencies. Download composer (see above) and run the following command\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}php composer.phar install
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsection*{2) Checking your System Configuration }

Before starting coding, make sure that your local system is properly configured for Symfony.

Execute the {\ttfamily check.\+php} script from the command line\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}php app/check.php
\end{DoxyVerb}


The script returns a status code of {\ttfamily 0} if all mandatory requirements are met, {\ttfamily 1} otherwise.

Access the {\ttfamily config.\+php} script from a browser\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}http://localhost/path/to/symfony/app/web/config.php
\end{DoxyVerb}


If you get any warnings or recommendations, fix them before moving on.

\subsection*{3) Browsing the Demo Application }

Congratulations! You're now ready to use Symfony.

From the {\ttfamily config.\+php} page, click the \char`\"{}\+Bypass configuration and go to the
\+Welcome page\char`\"{} link to load up your first Symfony page.

You can also use a web-\/based configurator by clicking on the \char`\"{}\+Configure your
\+Symfony Application online\char`\"{} link of the {\ttfamily config.\+php} page.

To see a real-\/live Symfony page in action, access the following page\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}web/app_dev.php/demo/hello/Fabien
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsection*{4) Getting started with Symfony }

This distribution is meant to be the starting point for your Symfony applications, but it also contains some sample code that you can learn from and play with.

A great way to start learning Symfony is via the \href{http://symfony.com/doc/2.3/quick_tour/the_big_picture.html}{\tt Quick Tour}, which will take you through all the basic features of Symfony2.

Once you're feeling good, you can move onto reading the official \href{http://symfony.com/doc/2.3/index.html}{\tt Symfony2 book}.

A default bundle, {\ttfamily Acme\+Demo\+Bundle}, shows you Symfony2 in action. After playing with it, you can remove it by following these steps\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item delete the {\ttfamily src/\+Acme} directory;
\item remove the routing entry referencing Acme\+Demo\+Bundle in {\ttfamily app/config/routing\+\_\+dev.\+yml};
\item remove the Acme\+Demo\+Bundle from the registered bundles in {\ttfamily app/\+App\+Kernel.\+php};
\item remove the {\ttfamily web/bundles/acmedemo} directory;
\item remove the {\ttfamily security.\+providers}, {\ttfamily security.\+firewalls.\+login} and {\ttfamily security.\+firewalls.\+secured\+\_\+area} entries in the {\ttfamily security.\+yml} file or tweak the security configuration to fit your needs.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{What's inside? }

The Symfony Standard Edition is configured with the following defaults\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
